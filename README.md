## Stripe Authorize

Intended as a companion to the Order Approver extension, this changes Stripe payments to work as authorize/capture, with the capture phase happening once an order has been accepted through Order Approver.

This is free and doesn't require a license, but you can [donate to Ryan](https://github.com/sponsors/ryanmitchell), the developer behind it, to show your appreciation.

This extension can be used as a boilerplate for other payment gateways, if you do create one please let me know so I can update the Order Approver documentation.



### Installation

1. Add to extensions/thoughtco/stripeauthorize inside Tasty Igniter install.
2. Enable extension in Systems -> Extensions
